# jumpscare-plugin

A browser plugin which allows you to configure periodic and random **jumpscares** from
whitelisted websites.

The goal of this project is to provide an alternative to website blockers. I've attempted
blocking websites I want to avoid habitually visiting many times and it's never worked.
I've since come to believe that abstaining isn't an effective solution.

I believe that providing yourself with alternative healthier behaviour is the best outcome,
however that's hard when the internet is designed to algorithmically take advantage
of your dopamine circuitry, endlessly scrolling through slop content in anticipation
of a reward.

This is an experiment in replacing that anticipation with fear! But I don't want to
instill any sense of shame, therefore you should be able to configure the plugin to
allow you to use the websites you enjoy, but set a defined limit after which you risk
experiencing a shock!

## Functionality

### Todo:
- [ ] Randomly timed jumpscares within a set time period
- [ ] Whitelist webpages you want the plugin to operate on
- [ ] Set a maximum usage timer, after which the plugin becomes active
- [ ] Randomizer switch, either guarantee a jumpscare as the usage timer runs out, or randomize its occurance
- [ ] Set a jumpscare timer, e.g. jumpscare me within 5, 10, or 15 minutes
